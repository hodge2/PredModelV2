simulate a population of "similar but not-identical people"

Using a generalized linear model with a Poisson response to create the seeds of such a model, with smoothed estimates of the number of people for each combination of demographics. I then can use iterative proportional fitting to force the marginal totals for each explanatory variable to match the population totals that were used to weight the original New Zealand Income Survey.
```{r}
simulated_pop <- expand.grid(d_agegrp, d_occupation)
names(simulated_pop) <-  c("agegrp_id", "occupation_id")

# take the agegrp and occupation_id columns (3 and 5) only
count_data = f_mainheader[,c(3,5)]
count_data = mutate(count_data,count = 1)
sum_data <- summarise(group_by(count_data, agegrp_id, occupation_id), count = sum(count))
simulated_pop = left_join(simulated_pop,sum_data, by=c("agegrp_id","occupation_id"))
simulated_pop$count[is.na(simulated_pop$count)]=0


model_pop <- glm(count ~ agegrp_id * occupation_id, data = simulated_pop, family = poisson)
 
simulated_pop$pop <- predict(model_pop, type = "response")

agegrp_pop <- f_mainheader %>%
   group_by(agegrp_id) %>%
   summarise(Freq = sum(wt))

occupation_pop <- f_mainheader %>%
   group_by(occupation_id) %>%
   summarise(Freq = sum(wt))

design_pop <- svydesign(~1, data = simulated_pop, weights = ~pop)

nzis_raked <- rake(design_pop,
                   sample = list(~agegrp_id, ~occupation_id),
                   population = list(agegrp_pop, occupation_pop),
                   control = list(maxit = 20, verbose = FALSE))

simulated_pop$pop <- weights(nzis_raked)


if(round(sum(simulated_pop$pop), -4) != 3460000){
   stop("You've got the wrong population counts.")
}

save(simulated_pop, file = "simulated_pop.rda")

```
